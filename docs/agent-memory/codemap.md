# Codemap

This file is a navigation index for `@xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp`. It is not a design spec and should stay concise. Update it when module ownership, tool flow, test layout, release flow, or agent harness structure changes in a way that would affect future handoffs.

## Runtime Entry Points

- `src/index.ts`: stdio startup entry point. Loads environment configuration and connects the reusable MCP server to `StdioServerTransport`.
- `src/server.ts`: reusable MCP `Server` instance. Registers `tools/list` and `tools/call`, delegates schemas and handlers, and applies generic secret-redacted error handling.
- `src/cli.ts`: package CLI entry point for local credential setup and health checks.
- `src/config.ts`: runtime configuration and preferred subtitle language normalization.

## MCP Tool Surface

- `src/server/tool-schemas.ts`: MCP tool list and input schemas.
- `src/server/tool-handlers.ts`: tool dispatch, input validation, sanitization, Bilibili API calls, and tool-specific recovery payloads.
- `src/server/error-response.ts`: shared text-content and structured error response helpers.

Current tool families:

- Credential setup, status, and package freshness: `get_credential_setup_instructions`, `check_bilibili_credentials`, `check_mcp_update`.
- Video content: `get_video_info`, `get_video_transcript`, `get_video_metadata`.
- Comments: `get_video_comments`.
- Chapters: `get_video_chapters`.

When adding or changing a public MCP tool, inspect both `tool-schemas.ts` and `tool-handlers.ts`, then update tests and user-facing docs.

## Bilibili Integration

- `src/bilibili/client.ts`: compatibility-oriented client layer and shared request behavior.
- `src/bilibili/http.ts`: HTTP helpers and login-status behavior.
- `src/bilibili/auth.ts`: Bilibili credential/auth helpers.
- `src/bilibili/wbi.ts`: WBI signing support.
- `src/bilibili/fingerprint.ts`: buvid/fingerprint support.
- `src/bilibili/video-api.ts`: video/subtitle/player API calls and response safety checks.
- `src/bilibili/navigation.ts`: shared Part/CID resolution for multi-Part videos.
- `src/bilibili/subtitle.ts`: subtitle selection, transcript formatting, timestamp output, range filtering, and fallback behavior.
- `src/bilibili/metadata.ts`: metadata retrieval, shaping, and Part summaries.
- `src/bilibili/chapters.ts`: Bilibili-provided Chapter (view_points) retrieval.
- `src/bilibili/comments-api.ts`: raw comments API access.
- `src/bilibili/comments.ts`: comments retrieval, filtering, and response shaping.
- `src/bilibili/types.ts`: shared Bilibili-facing types.

## Utilities

## Tests

- `tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts`: stdio and MCP handler smoke coverage.
- `tests/helpers/mcp.ts`: centralized test access to MCP request handlers.

Default verification:

- `npm run build`
- `npm test`
- `npm pack --dry-run` when package metadata, publish contents, release flow, or package entry points change.

## Package And Release

- `package.json`: npm metadata, binary mapping, scripts, dependencies, and publish file allowlist.
- `package-lock.json`: npm lockfile; update through npm tooling, not manual edits.
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml`: trusted-publishing npm release workflow for version tags.
- `README.md`, `README_EN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CHANGELOG_EN.md`: user-facing install, credential, usage, and release notes.

Before release-oriented work, verify local package state with `npm pack --dry-run`, live registry state with `npm view`, and remote release/Actions state with `gh` or GitHub tooling.

## Agent Harness

- `AGENTS.md`: Codex/project-wide operating rules, fixed skill/MCP/CLI/subagent triggers, and Codex-to-Claude collaboration model.

## Hooks And Runtime Memory

- `.claude/settings.local.json`: Claude Code project hook registration.
- `.codex/hooks.json`: Codex app hook registration.
- `.codex/scripts/`: shared hook scripts and local harness utilities.
- `.codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`: active implementation-plan tracking for phase-gated learning reminders.
- `.codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py`: generated proposal queue writer.
- `.codex/scripts/context_budget.py`: context budget auditing.
- `.codex/scripts/stop_summary.py`: lightweight stop summaries, strategic compact advice, phase learning reminders, and non-mutating harness artifact reminders for codemap, harness-security, and harness-eval checks.
- `.codex/scripts/test_stop_summary.py`: deterministic stdlib-only tests for path matching and all three reminder branches.
- `.codex/scripts/pre_compact.py`: pre-compact checkpoint support.
- `.codex/scripts/post_tool_use.py`: failed shell observation capture and candidate scoring.

Runtime observations are intentionally separate from formal memory:

- Codex runtime observations: `C:\Users\ZX\.codex\memories\bilibili-mcp\`.
- Claude runtime observations: `.claude\memory\` and `.claude\runtime\`.

## Project Agents And Skills

Claude Code subagents:

- `.claude/agents/credential-sanitizer.md`: credential cleanup and leak checks.
- `.claude/agents/package-maintainer.md`: package metadata, scripts, lockfile, and pack contents.
- `.claude/agents/test-baseline-builder.md`: deterministic Vitest baseline and test helpers.
- `.claude/agents/build-error-resolver.md`: TypeScript, ESM, MCP, and build failures.
- `.claude/agents/risk-reviewer.md`: post-change bug/security/regression review.
- `.claude/agents/release-verifier.md`: release readiness and package verification.

Codex custom agents:

- `.codex/agents/stabilization-reviewer.toml`: plan and scope review.
- `.codex/agents/risk-reviewer.toml`: focused risk review.
- `.codex/agents/release-verifier.toml`: release readiness verification.

Fixed skill trigger details live in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Do not assume Codex skills, `.agents\skills`, and Claude Code skills are shared unless the skill exists in the target runtime.

Matt Pocock workflow skills are installed in both Codex and Claude Code. GitHub Issues hold Matt specs and tickets, substantial Claude implementation continues through file-backed handoffs, and Codex uses Paseo CLI to launch one bounded implementation agent. Do not invoke Superpowers skills; project Git, security, verification, and no-autonomous-team rules override conflicting skill defaults.

## Common Change Routes

- New MCP tool: `product-requirements` if scope is unclear, `domain-modeling` if terminology changes, `codebase-design` or `system-design` if interfaces/architecture change, then edit schemas, handlers, tests, README/changelog as needed.
- Credential behavior: inspect `credentials.ts`, `credential-guidance.ts`, server handlers, and secret-oriented tests; use secret/risk review before commit or release.
- Subtitle/transcript behavior: inspect `video-api.ts`, `subtitle.ts`, validation/sanitization utilities, transcript tests, and security limits.
- Comments behavior: inspect `comments-api.ts`, `comments.ts`, handler validation, and comments tool tests.
- Package/release behavior: inspect `package.json`, lockfile, publish workflow, README/changelog, and run build/test/pack verification.
- Harness/rules work: inspect `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/agent-memory/README.md`, `docs/agent-memory/harness-security.md`, `docs/agent-memory/harness-eval.md`, relevant memory files, templates, hook scripts, and context budget impact.
- External research-dependent work: create a note from `docs/templates/research-note.md` under `docs/research/` when external facts materially affect the decision.
- Release/install/client QA work: create a checklist from `docs/templates/qa-checklist.md` under `docs/qa/` when public install, credential, stdio, package, or client behavior is affected.
