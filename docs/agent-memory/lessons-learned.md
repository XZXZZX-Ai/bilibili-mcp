# Lessons Learned

## 2026-05-27

- Lesson: Do not assume `.agents\skills` skills are available to Claude Code.
- Evidence: `vitest`, `secret-scanning`, and `github-actions-docs` were first installed under `.agents\skills`; Claude Code needed copies under `.claude\skills`.
- Future behavior: Check the target agent's actual skill directory before claiming a skill is installed for that agent.

- Lesson: Removing hard-coded Bilibili Cookie values must not remove Cookie-based subtitle access.
- Evidence: User clarified that subtitles may require Cookie access.
- Future behavior: Externalize credentials while preserving authenticated retrieval paths.

- Lesson: Some existing Markdown and terminal output can contain mojibake.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` include encoding safety rules.
- Future behavior: Verify files as UTF-8 before copying or rewriting Chinese text.

## 2026-05-28

- Lesson: The project `.codex\` directory can be suitable for hook configuration but not necessarily for mutable runtime logs.
- Evidence: A dry run of `post_tool_use.py --agent codex` failed with Windows access denial when creating `.codex\memory`.
- Future behavior: Store Codex runtime hook observations under `C:\Users\ZX\.codex\memories\bilibili-mcp\`.

## 2026-06-04

- Lesson: Separate "memory capture worked" from "learning proposal promoted" when evaluating the agent memory system.
- Evidence: Phase 2 and Phase 3 verification entries were written to `docs/agent-memory/verification-log.md`, and both Codex and Claude hook runtime files existed, but `pending-learning-proposals.md` had no proposals above threshold.
- Future behavior: Report these as different states: formal verification memory can be complete even when controlled learning has no approved promotion.

- Lesson: Active-plan tracking should filter both candidate plans and previous runtime state through the same tracked-plan rule.
- Evidence: `plan_tracker.py` initially ignored non-implementation plans in fresh resolution but still preserved an old unchecked previous plan from runtime state; adding the same eligibility check to `previous_plan` fixed Codex and Claude runtime state.
- Future behavior: Before starting a new phase or relying on phase-gated learning reminders, run `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py` and regenerate learning proposals for both `codex` and `claude` to confirm runtime state follows the intended plan.

- Lesson: Release workflow guidance must be refreshed from official documentation when touching npm trusted publishing or GitHub Actions OIDC.
- Evidence: Phase 4 Task 5 checked npm Trusted Publishers, npm provenance statements, GitHub Actions permissions, and GitHub Node.js package publishing docs before changing `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- Future behavior: Do not rely on stale memory for Node/npm minimums, provenance, OIDC permissions, or registry setup; re-check official docs before release workflow edits.

- Lesson: A polished publish workflow is not the same as a completed release.
- Evidence: Phase 4 updated README, changelogs, package metadata, and publish workflow, but final verification explicitly recorded no tag, no GitHub release, and no npm publish.
- Future behavior: When the user asks to start release execution, include npm trusted publishing setup confirmation, final local verification, tag push, Actions monitoring, and post-publish release notes as separate gates.

- Lesson: `npm install -g npm@latest` is acceptable as a trusted-publishing compatibility measure but remains a moving CI target.
- Evidence: Phase 4 kept this step to satisfy npm CLI trusted publishing support while recording it as a remaining release risk.
- Future behavior: Before long-term release automation hardening, consider pinning npm to a known compatible version instead of relying on `latest`.

## 2026-06-05

- Lesson: README-only credential guidance is insufficient for agent-driven MCP installation.
- Evidence: The user clarified that most users install MCP servers through agents, and that the installing agent should guide the user through Cookie setup.
- Future behavior: Credential-dependent MCP tools should advertise setup dependencies in `tools/list`, expose a dedicated setup-instructions tool, and include actionable `next_steps` on credential-related errors.

- Lesson: Generic MCP error handlers can silently drop structured recovery guidance.
- Evidence: Review found that content tools using the generic catch path did not initially return `code` and `next_steps` for `BilibiliAPIError("COOKIE_EXPIRED")`; a regression test was added in `tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts`.
- Future behavior: When adding new error helpers, verify both specialized error branches and generic catch branches.

- Lesson: Separate generated learning queues from runtime caches when cleaning the worktree.
- Evidence: `pending-learning-proposals.md` belongs to the controlled-learning review queue, but `.codex/scripts/__pycache__/plan_tracker.cpython-311.pyc` is Python bytecode cache.
- Future behavior: Preserve and review generated memory files deliberately; ignore or remove runtime cache artifacts without treating them as formal memory.

- Lesson: Credential source reporting currently covers environment variables and global config, not in-memory-only credentials.
- Evidence: `CredentialManager.getCredentialSource()` returns `env`, `global_config`, or `none` based on environment and global config file state.
- Future behavior: If a future MCP login flow creates in-memory credentials, update credential status reporting so it does not falsely report `none`.

## 2026-06-14

- Lesson: Credential-status tests that assert `source: none` must hide the developer machine's global Bilibili config.
- Evidence: Focused credential guidance tests failed on a machine with global credentials configured because `credentialManager.clearCredentials()` only clears in-memory state and does not remove `~/.bilibili-mcp/config.json`.
- Future behavior: Mock or isolate global config file detection when testing the no-credential branch; do not depend on a developer machine having no configured Cookies.

## 2026-07-19

- Lesson: A single promise that represents only the current rate-limit wait does not form a concurrent request queue.
- Evidence: Three simultaneous `throttledFetch` calls produced a minimum start gap of about `0.155ms` against a configured `500ms` interval because multiple callers awaited the same old promise and then waited together.
- Future behavior: Reserve a caller's place synchronously in a normalized promise chain, test concurrent starts directly, and distinguish prior queue time from the caller's own timeout-covered wait.

- Lesson: A completed Paseo top-level task can remain `running` when a requested Claude subagent does not return.
- Evidence: Both `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` invocations failed to return promptly even though the top-level agent completed the implementation, verification, and report; Codex explicitly stopped only that agent after preserving its output.
- Future behavior: Use bounded wait windows, let the top-level agent complete the same scoped work when a subagent stalls, and stop the finished agent without restarting the Paseo daemon or touching unrelated agents.

- Lesson: Adding a second public subtitle flow without reusing the existing empty-list credential policy caused documented behavior to drift.
- Evidence: `getVideoInfoWithSubtitle` verified login on an empty subtitle list, while `getVideoTranscriptData` silently returned description when fallback was enabled; the focused test reproduced the mismatch in 9ms.
- Future behavior: Keep credential interpretation in one private helper and test the documented public interface whenever a sibling flow is added or changed.

- Lesson: A fallback intended to keep an operation available must not be cached when the triggering error may be transient.
- Evidence: The general subtitle-error branch cached a description fallback for one hour, so a second call with a successful mocked subtitle response still returned `description` and never retried `getVideoSubtitle`.
- Future behavior: Test fallback cache policy with two calls using the same key: transient failure first, recovery second; preserve caching only for durable successful results.

- Lesson: Cache keys must include every option that changes post-processing, not only options sent to the upstream API.
- Evidence: With an explicit limit, brief and detailed comment calls shared `limit-5` even though detailed mode appends child replies; the second call returned the cached one-comment brief result instead of four processed comments.
- Future behavior: For option-sensitive caches, add paired-call tests that vary one output-affecting option while holding upstream pagination options constant.

- Lesson: Correcting always-loaded agent rules is incomplete if callable custom-agent definitions keep the same stale instruction.
- Evidence: After `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` were corrected, completion audit found four `.claude/agents` and `.codex/agents` files still directing agents to treat `npm test` as a stub.
- Future behavior: When a durable harness fact changes, scan all current rule consumers while preserving dated historical records; do not limit verification to the two top-level instruction files.

- Lesson: Process readiness tests should wait for the observable ready event, not an elapsed-time guess.
- Evidence: The stdio smoke test killed the server after 300ms; 5 of 20 measured starts needed more than 300ms even though all succeeded, producing empty-stderr flakes.
- Future behavior: Use a bounded event-driven readiness promise, reject on spawn error or premature exit, register close observation before kill, and await cleanup; keep the internal timeout below the test framework timeout.

- Lesson: Wrapper layers should not prefetch data that the delegated API layer already owns, especially when the fetched value is unused.
- Evidence: `getVideoCommentsData` fetched video info and assigned `cid` without reading it, while `getVideoComments` immediately fetched the same metadata to compute the required oid.
- Future behavior: Trace ownership through compatibility re-exports before optimizing; lock the wrapper boundary with a dependency-call regression, then delete the unused request instead of adding metadata parameters.

- Lesson: A validated public maximum is not implemented if a lower layer silently caps one request below it and the orchestration never paginates.
- Evidence: Comment `limit` accepted 1-50, but the API capped `ps` at 20 and the wrapper requested only page 1; the failing-first regression observed one call instead of page sizes 20, 20, and 10.
- Future behavior: When public counts exceed upstream page sizes, test the boundary with sequential page calls, early exhaustion, defensive truncation, and any post-processing that can expand the final result.

- Lesson: A boolean status helper must not collapse transport failure into a definitive negative state.
- Evidence: `checkLoginStatus` returned `isLogin:false` for HTTP 503 and thrown fetch failures, causing credential callers to treat an unknown network state as logged out.
- Future behavior: Reuse the shared HTTP path, preserve successful false responses only, and verify both the low-level error type and the public MCP structured error shape.

- Lesson: A retry allowlist is ineffective when a later broad error-type check can override a rejected explicit status.
- Evidence: `NetworkError` with status 403 missed the transient status allowlist but then matched the generic `NetworkError` name branch and executed four attempts.
- Future behavior: Treat an explicit numeric status as a final allowlist decision; use name/code retries only when no HTTP status exists, and lock all three branches in one compact matrix.

- Lesson: A correct retry policy still fails when one HTTP caller omits status metadata while constructing its shared error type.
- Evidence: `getSubtitleContent` received HTTP 403 but created `NetworkError` without `response.status`, so the error looked status-less and retried four times.
- Future behavior: When adding an HTTP error call site, preserve the response status and test retry behavior through the real caller seam, not only through the retry utility.

- Lesson: Error metadata must survive both the original throw and any outer wrapping layer.
- Evidence: The WBI nav path omitted `navRes.status` at the source and its outer catch created another `NetworkError` without carrying nested status metadata.
- Future behavior: Trace shared errors end to end; a regression should assert both retry count and the final observable metadata.

- Lesson: Transport errors must be normalized before retry classification, and request timers need cleanup on failure as well as success.
- Evidence: Raw WBI `TypeError` reached `withRetry` unrecognized and stopped after one attempt, while `clearTimeout` was skipped because it followed the failed await.
- Future behavior: Put normalization and cleanup at the fetch boundary with `try/catch/finally`, then assert attempts, cleanup count, and final error metadata together.

- Lesson: Optional best-effort requests still need deterministic resource cleanup even when failure is intentionally swallowed.
- Evidence: `getBuvid` correctly returned `null` on fetch rejection but skipped `clearTimeout`, leaving the timer pending.
- Future behavior: Keep fallback semantics separate from cleanup guarantees, and assert both the fallback result and exact request/cleanup counts.

## 2026-07-20

- Lesson: An undocumented consumer response must be verified against a live first-party sample before finalizing fixtures and types.
- Evidence: The first Chapter implementation modeled `view_points[].title`, while the live player response uses `view_points[].content`; the incorrect fixture made the initial tests pass with empty real titles.
- Future behavior: Cache the live response shape in a research note, use the observed field as authoritative with defensive fallback, and include at least one fixture matching the real field names.

- Lesson: Shared navigation must not move cache checks behind a new network request or duplicate an existing view request.
- Evidence: The first implementation fetched video info inside the resolver and again in callers, and the first repair still checked the video-info cache after resolution.
- Future behavior: Add exact dependency-call regressions for default flows and cache hits whenever a shared fetch/selection seam is introduced.

- Lesson: Deleting a TypeScript source file is incomplete when `tsc` writes into an uncleared output directory used by `npm pack`.
- Evidence: After deleting unused `src/bilibili/auth.ts`, the first build and package dry run still included four stale `dist/bilibili/auth.*` artifacts; a guarded clean-before-compile step reduced the package from 128 to 124 entries.
- Future behavior: For source deletions, verify package contents as well as imports and compilation, and keep the build clean step portable rather than hard-coding a checkout path.
