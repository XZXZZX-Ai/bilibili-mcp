# Handoff Log

## 2026-05-27

- Owner: Codex
- Objective: Design a repository-local learning and memory system inspired by ECC.
- Files in scope: `docs/agent-memory/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `C:\Users\ZX\.codex\skills\bilibili-mcp-memory`, `C:\Users\ZX\.claude\skills\bilibili-mcp-memory`.
- Constraints: Do not enable Claude Code hooks in the first phase. Do not store secrets. Preserve the manual Codex-plans and Claude-executes workflow.
- Verification expected: Confirm memory files exist, agent instructions reference them, both skills exist, and no hook settings were modified.
- Unresolved risks: Later ECC-style hooks require a separate opt-in design and rollback path.

## 2026-05-28

- Owner: Codex
- Objective: Start Phase 2 by designing and planning the compatibility-first split of `src/bilibili/client.ts`.
- Files in scope: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-bilibili-client-split-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-28-bilibili-client-split-implementation-plan.md`, `docs/agent-memory/decisions.md`.
- Constraints: Preserve Cookie-based subtitle access, WBI-first subtitle retrieval, `/x/player/v2` fallback, MCP tool schemas, and compatibility exports from `src/bilibili/client.ts`.
- Verification expected: Claude Code should execute the plan task-by-task, starting with mocked Vitest coverage for subtitle fallback behavior, then run `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Unresolved risks: Current worktree still contains unrelated agent/hooks configuration changes; Phase 2 implementation should not mix those into the code refactor commit unless the user explicitly chooses to.

## 2026-06-05

- Owner: Codex planned and reviewed; Claude Code implemented the credential-guidance feature from the handoff.
- Objective: Make agent-driven MCP installation able to discover and present Bilibili Cookie setup instructions without exposing Cookie values.
- Files in scope: `src/server.ts`, `src/utils/credential-guidance.ts`, `src/utils/credentials.ts`, Bilibili credential error paths, README files, and focused Vitest coverage.
- Constraints: Do not put Cookie values in MCP client config, logs, tests, or responses; preserve Cookie-based access through environment variables and the global credential helper.
- Verification expected: `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm pack --dry-run`, secret/stale-client scans, and review of generic `COOKIE_EXPIRED` error handling.
- Result: Codex review added a missing generic-catch `COOKIE_EXPIRED` regression fix and confirmed the feature passed the expected verification commands.
- Unresolved risks: Global config source is not directly covered by a dedicated unit test, and in-memory-only credentials are not currently reported as a credential source.

## 2026-06-18

- Owner: Codex prepared a Claude Code execution handoff.
- Objective: Plan a one-pass Claude Code implementation for unified structured MCP error responses covering network errors, access restrictions, paid videos, disabled comments, API rate limits, credential expiration, validation failures, and unavailable subtitles.
- Files in scope: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-structured-error-guidance-implementation-plan.md`, `docs/agent-memory/handoffs/2026-06-18-structured-error-guidance-task-ticket.md`, and `docs/agent-memory/handoffs/2026-06-18-structured-error-guidance-codex-to-claude.md`.
- Constraints: Preserve MCP tool names and input schemas, keep `error` / `message` / `code` / `next_steps` compatibility, add bilingual structured fields, do not expose credentials, and do not commit, push, tag, or publish.
- Verification expected: Claude Code should run focused Vitest coverage, full `npm test`, `npm run build`, error-code scan, and added-diff secret scan, then return a Markdown report with the required Harness Artifacts section.
- Unresolved risks: The plan intentionally changes disabled comments from silent empty success to structured `COMMENTS_DISABLED`; Codex should review that behavior and README wording after Claude Code reports back.

## 2026-07-19

- Owner: Codex diagnosed and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #2.
- Objective: Make concurrent `throttledFetch` calls respect the configured interval between request starts.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/http.ts`, `tests/bilibili-http.test.ts`, and the Claude execution report.
- Constraints: Keep the public interface and timeout/retry/error behavior stable; serialize starts rather than complete responses; no dependencies, broad HTTP refactor, Git mutations, or Superpowers skills.
- Verification expected: red-before-green focused Vitest evidence, full `npm test`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and a scoped diff review.
- Current evidence: The temporary direct repro observed a minimum concurrent start gap of about `0.155ms` against a `500ms` configured interval.
- Result: Paseo agent `5f6dd5d6-bc9a-438d-a03c-ca43c8d005ec` implemented the bounded fix and report; Codex corrected timeout placement through same-scope repair prompts, independently verified 2 focused tests, 157 full-suite tests, build, diff checks, and a five-area risk review. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Empty Transcript Credential Detection

- Owner: Codex diagnosed and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #3.
- Objective: Apply the documented empty-subtitle login verification to `getVideoTranscriptData` without changing legitimate logged-in fallback behavior.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/subtitle.ts`, `tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts`, and the Claude execution report.
- Constraints: One private helper shared by transcript/info flows; preserve cache, fallback, response, schema, export, and credential-safety behavior; no broad subtitle refactor, Git mutation, or Superpowers skill.
- Verification expected: 9ms red-before-green focused Vitest, full transcript tests, full `npm test`, build, diff checks, and focused risk review.
- Result: Paseo agent `adae5bbf-0707-4688-bed0-5a4a131f8ab1` implemented the private helper and report; `test-baseline-builder` passed the focused test review and `risk-reviewer` found no blocking issue. Codex corrected report facts, independently verified 1 focused test, 15 transcript tests, 158 full-suite tests, build, and diff/debug checks, then archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Transient Subtitle Fallback Cache

- Owner: Codex diagnosed and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #4.
- Objective: Prevent a temporary subtitle retrieval error from caching the description fallback and blocking later retries.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/subtitle.ts`, `tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Preserve successful subtitle caching, `COOKIE_EXPIRED` propagation, response shapes, cache keys, and unrelated Issue #3 changes; no broad refactor, Git mutation, or Superpowers skill.
- Verification expected: red-before-green retry regression, full transcript tests, full `npm test`, build, diff checks, and bounded test/risk review.
- Result: Paseo agent `78b7412c-791c-4266-a069-d69cbf50e3c3` removed only the erroneous error-fallback cache write and corrected its misleading comment. `test-baseline-builder` confirmed the diagnosis and `risk-reviewer` found no blocking issue. Codex independently verified 1 focused test, 16 transcript tests, 159 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks, then archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Comment Cache Detail-Level Collision

- Owner: Codex diagnosed and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #5.
- Objective: Separate brief and detailed comment cache entries when an explicit limit is present.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/comments.ts`, `tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Preserve API arguments, sorting, reply processing, response shapes, and identical-option cache reuse; no `CacheManager` change, broad refactor, Git mutation, or Superpowers skill.
- Verification expected: red-before-green collision regression, full comments tests, full `npm test`, build, diff checks, and bounded test/risk review.
- Result: Paseo agent `cbb69c94-dc55-469a-b21f-786080845639` made the one-line cache-key fix. `test-baseline-builder` confirmed the deterministic test seam and `risk-reviewer` found no blocking issue. Codex corrected one stale report statement, independently verified 1 focused test, 13 comments tests, 160 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks, then archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Real npm Test Guidance

- Owner: Codex prepared and expanded a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #6.
- Objective: Remove false current guidance that described the real Vitest suite as an `npm test` stub.
- Files in scope: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, three `.claude/agents` files, `.codex/agents/release-verifier.toml`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Preserve historical dated evidence, higher-priority boundaries, security/Git/Paseo/Matt/no-Superpowers rules, hooks, permissions, source, tests, and package files; reduce or preserve context overhead.
- Verification expected: live `npm test`, build, expanded stale-guidance scan, diff/UTF-8/secret/context checks, and harness-security risk review.
- Result: Paseo agent `c48ae9d4-dc36-42fd-820f-3fda3aebd2a7` corrected the six current rule files in two bounded passes. Codex completion audit expanded the initial two-file scope to four callable agent definitions, independently verified 160 tests and build, confirmed zero stale matches and stable-lower context overhead, then archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Stdio Smoke Readiness

- Owner: Codex diagnosed and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #7.
- Objective: Remove the fixed-delay race from the MCP stdio startup smoke test.
- Files in scope: `tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts` and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Test-only event-driven readiness; preserve exact startup-stderr and empty-stdout assertions; bounded timeout/error/exit handling; reliable process cleanup; no retries, dependencies, production changes, Git mutation, or Superpowers skill.
- Verification expected: original red loop evidence, focused test, two 20-iteration green loops, full smoke file, full suite, build, diff/debug/encoding/secret checks, and bounded test/risk reviews.
- Result: Paseo agent `46463ded-c50b-4119-8861-2b445cf20e5d` replaced the 300ms sleep with one stderr readiness listener and a 3s timeout. Codex requested cleanup-order, framework-timeout, required-subagent, and duplicate-listener repairs, then independently verified 20/20 focused iterations, 2/2 smoke tests, 160/160 full-suite tests, build, and scans before archiving the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Redundant Comment Metadata Request

- Owner: Codex diagnosed and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff for GitHub Issue #8.
- Objective: Remove the unused outer video-metadata request while preserving the lower-level oid lookup.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/comments.ts`, `tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Delete only the outer import/request/cid block; preserve `comments-api.ts`, interfaces, cache, arguments, errors, responses, tests, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries.
- Verification expected: focused red/green dependency-call regression, full comments tests, full suite, build, diff/ownership scans, and bounded test/risk reviews.
- Result: Paseo agent `3fd6962a-b8e4-4b0d-a106-0b531ee3654e` removed the dead outer request. Codex enforced the required `test-baseline-builder` review, independently verified 1 focused test, 14 comments tests, 161 full-suite tests, build, and ownership/diff checks, then archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Comment Limit Pagination

- Owner: Codex used `product-requirements` to formalize the existing 1-50 contract, created GitHub Issue #9, and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Honor comment limits above 20 with sequential bounded pagination while preserving top-level limit semantics and detailed-mode reply expansion.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/comments.ts`, `tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`, the PRD, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Pages of at most 20; stop on completion, empty page, or short page; preserve schemas, validation, cache, sorting, errors, responses, existing dirty work, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries.
- Result: Paseo agent `27b3b1fd-a2ea-4a64-983f-a80ece1d3b05` implemented the loop after three expected failing regressions. `test-baseline-builder` strengthened detailed-mode coverage and `risk-reviewer` found no blocker. Codex independently verified 20 comments tests, 167 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks, marked Issue #9 `ready-for-human`, and archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Login Status Network Errors

- Owner: Codex built a no-file red harness, created GitHub Issue #10, and prepared a credential-safe Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Preserve HTTP, timeout, and connection failures during Bilibili login checks instead of returning a false logged-out state.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/http.ts`, HTTP and MCP error tests, the QA checklist, and Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Delete the duplicate login-check network stack, reuse `fetchWithoutWBI`, normalize native fetch `TypeError` at the shared seam, preserve successful `isLogin:false`, retry/timeout policy, public schemas, credential secrecy, prior dirty work, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries.
- Result: Paseo agent `0b852f31-699b-4045-8453-d601153dd29b` implemented the deletion-first fix. Codex required zero-unhandled-rejection tests, an MCP-level `NETWORK_ERROR` regression, truthful QA/report corrections, and a scoped secret scan. Both bounded reviews accepted the result; Codex independently verified 17 focused tests, 171 full-suite tests, build, the original 503 harness, and diff/scoped scans before marking Issue #10 `ready-for-human` and archiving the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Non-Retryable HTTP Status

- Owner: Codex reproduced the shared retry-policy defect with a zero-backoff harness, created GitHub Issue #11, and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Make explicit HTTP status codes authoritative so non-transient statuses do not fall through to broad error-name retries.
- Files in scope: `src/utils/retry.ts`, `tests/retry.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Preserve the transient status allowlist, status-less connection retries, retry counts/delays/logs/stats, existing dirty work, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries; add no abstraction.
- Result: Paseo agent `f02326cd-122f-4029-b3f9-388928dafe86` added the authoritative status branch and removed the redundant 429 check. Both bounded reviews accepted the result. Codex compressed the repeated tests into one matrix, independently verified 13 focused and 174 full-suite tests, build, the original harness, and diff/debug scans, marked Issue #11 `ready-for-human`, and archived the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Subtitle HTTP Status Propagation

- Owner: Codex built a focused failing-first Vitest reproduction, created GitHub Issue #12, and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Preserve explicit subtitle response statuses so the shared retry policy can reject non-transient HTTP failures immediately.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/video-api.ts`, `tests/bilibili-video-api.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Propagate only the existing response status; preserve retry policy, redirect/host/size protections, public schemas, prior dirty work, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries.
- Result: Paseo agent `84849281-fe2e-431d-a6cc-bc90b05a1c27` added the missing constructor argument. Both bounded reviews accepted the result. Codex independently verified the focused 403 regression, 175/175 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks before marking Issue #12 `ready-for-human` and archiving the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 WBI HTTP Status Propagation

- Owner: Codex reproduced the WBI 403 retry and metadata loss, created GitHub Issue #13, and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Preserve the WBI nav response status before retry classification and through the final wrapped error.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/wbi.ts`, `tests/bilibili-wbi.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Two-point status propagation only; preserve retry policy, cache, timeout, key extraction, logging, public interfaces, prior dirty work, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries.
- Result: Paseo agent `8b0829d1-9e21-46a9-914f-956ac35f8cab` implemented the two-line typed fix. Codex required a same-scope repair when the first report skipped mandatory reviews; both subagents then accepted the result. Codex independently verified 11 focused and 176 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks before marking Issue #13 `ready-for-human` and archiving the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 WBI Transport Retry And Timeout Cleanup

- Owner: Codex reproduced the missing TypeError retry and timeout cleanup, created GitHub Issue #14, and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Normalize native WBI transport failures before retry classification and clear each attempt's timeout on every outcome.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/wbi.ts`, `tests/bilibili-wbi.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: One local `try/catch/finally`; preserve AbortError, Issue #13 status behavior, shared retry policy, cache, signatures, logging, public interfaces, prior dirty work, and no-Superpowers/Git boundaries.
- Result: Paseo agent `76262250-24a2-4882-95d5-e47d11b43454` implemented the local fix. `test-baseline-builder` accepted the tests; `risk-reviewer` stalled, so the top-level agent completed the bounded checklist. Codex strengthened the final metadata assertion and independently verified 12 focused and 177 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks before marking Issue #14 `ready-for-human` and archiving the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-19 Fingerprint Timeout Cleanup

- Owner: Codex reproduced the optional fingerprint timer leak, created GitHub Issue #15, and prepared a Paseo-managed Claude Code handoff.
- Objective: Guarantee timeout cleanup on fingerprint fetch failure while preserving the one-attempt `null` fallback.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/fingerprint.ts`, `tests/bilibili-fingerprint.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff reports.
- Constraints: Move only existing cleanup into a guaranteed path; no retry, abstraction, fallback/cache/caller change, prior dirty-work reversal, Superpowers, or Git mutation.
- Result: Paseo agent `314f3acd-c916-4267-864f-6a6c20cd4782` moved cleanup into `finally`. `risk-reviewer` accepted the diff; `test-baseline-builder` added the missing one-fetch assertion. Codex independently verified 28 related and 178 full-suite tests, build, and diff checks before marking Issue #15 `ready-for-human` and archiving the agent. No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-07-20 MCP Server Version Synchronization

- Owner: Codex created a bounded local task ticket and launched Paseo agent `f0bd3173-6b18-497a-8392-f28e6667bc32` for implementation.
- Objective: Remove the stale hard-coded MCP server version and prevent future drift from `package.json.version`.
- Files in scope: `src/server.ts`, `tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts`, and the Codex/Claude handoff records.
- Result: The agent reused the CLI's existing Node ESM package-version loading pattern and added one Vitest regression. Codex independently verified the compiled server reports `1.6.4`, all 181 tests and the build pass, and no package, dependency, tool, credential, release, commit, or push change occurred.

## 2026-07-20 v1.6.5 Source Preparation

- Owner: Codex created a bounded task ticket and launched Paseo agent `0fb72c3f-dff0-4dc1-96d6-027979b8a628` for package-source preparation.
- Objective: Prepare the MCP metadata fix as patch version `1.6.5` for a scoped commit and push without triggering publication.
- Files in scope: package metadata, bilingual changelogs, prior version-fix source/test files, and handoff/verification records; the generated learning-proposal file remained excluded.
- Result: The agent synchronized package versions and changelogs; `release-verifier` found no blocker. The Paseo daemon stopped before the requested `package-maintainer` repair completed, so Codex performed the equivalent package/lock/tarball audit, independently passed all release gates, and retained tag/npm publication as a separate unauthorized step.

## 2026-07-20 Navigable Transcript v1.7.0

- Owner: Codex produced the PRD, ADR, task ticket, research note, QA checklist, and bounded Paseo handoff; Claude Code agent `b529301e-7bcf-4570-a4e9-8c71cfabf851` implemented and repaired the feature.
- Objective: Add timestamped/one-sided-or-bounded transcript reads, explicit multi-Part selection, normalized Part discovery, and platform-provided Chapters without changing existing defaults or adding dependencies.
- Review: Codex's Standards/Spec review found incorrect `view_points` mapping, duplicate default requests, swallowed errors, metadata scope creep, schema drift, and missing package synchronization. Same-scope repairs plus `test-baseline-builder`, `package-maintainer`, `risk-reviewer`, and `release-verifier` closed the findings; a final Codex pass moved cache lookup before networking and aligned returned Part identity with the selected CID.
- Result: Codex independently passed 93 focused and 243 full-suite tests, build, zero-production-vulnerability audit, 128-file package dry run, real stdio discovery, UTF-8/diff/secret scans, and live read-only checks showing 19 Parts and 6 valid Chapters. Commit `bd15438` was pushed, annotated tag `v1.7.0` triggered successful trusted npm publication, and the non-draft GitHub Release was created.

## 2026-07-20 README Sync And v1.7.1

- Owner: Codex prepared the handoff; Claude Code executed directly.
- Objective: Bring both READMEs in line with current source facts (8 tools, 244 tests, runtime env vars, build wording, Codex/Paseo/Claude workflow) and prepare source version `1.7.1` without publication.
- Files in scope: `README.md`, `README_EN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CHANGELOG_EN.md`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `docs/agent-memory/active-work.md`, `project-facts.md`, `handoff-log.md`, `verification-log.md`.
- Constraints: No MCP tool, runtime, dependency, test, workflow, or dist/ changes. No commit, push, tag, or publish. Preserve prior task's uncommitted legacy-auth/config cleanup changes. Do not edit `pending-learning-proposals.md`.
- Verification passed: Codex independently confirmed a clean build, 244/244 tests, npm pack dry-run (`v1.7.1`, 124 entries, no `auth.*` artifacts), diff integrity, README/source consistency, and a scoped added-content secret scan. The delegated risk-reviewer did not finish within its bounded wait, so Codex performed the final review.
- Unresolved risks: npm latest and GitHub Release remain `v1.7.0` until separately published.

## 2026-07-20 Legacy Auth And Config Cleanup

- Owner: Codex created a bounded local task ticket and launched Paseo agent `85330923-8d1a-45b7-af04-69cdf187ba2b`; the agent used the project `package-maintainer` subagent for the package/build repair.
- Objective: Delete the unused authentication module, remove inert package configuration, connect runtime cache sizing, remove stale Smithery wording, and prevent deleted modules from surviving in publishable build output.
- Files in scope: `src/bilibili/auth.ts`, `src/utils/cache.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `tests/cache.test.ts`, `package.json`, the codemap, and task handoff/report records.
- Result: The unused 220-line module and inert package block were deleted, both caches now use `config.maxCacheSize`, and the build performs a guarded portable `dist` clean before `tsc`. Codex independently verified the clean build, 244/244 tests, a 124-entry package with no `auth.*` or sentinel artifact, scoped reference scans, and `git diff --check`. No commit, push, PR, release, or publish was performed.
