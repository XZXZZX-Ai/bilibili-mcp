# Verification Log

## 2026-05-27

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed before memory-system work.
- Area: Stabilization baseline.
- Caveat: This result does not verify the memory-system files because they are documentation and skill configuration.

- Command: `git status --short`
- Result: Worktree contains intentional deletes for `smithery.json` and `smithery.yaml`, plus untracked `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/`.
- Area: Repository state before memory-system implementation.
- Caveat: Do not assume all untracked files belong to a single commit without reviewing scope.

## 2026-05-28

- Command: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codex/hooks.json','utf8')); JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.claude/settings.local.json','utf8')); console.log('all hook json ok')"`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Claude Code and Codex app hook JSON configuration.
- Caveat: This validates JSON syntax, not the external app trust prompt.

- Command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\.codex\scripts\session-start.ps1`
- Result: Passed and printed repository context, git status, active roadmap, and project memory previews.
- Area: SessionStart hook script.
- Caveat: Output is bounded by script line limits.

- Command: Synthetic failed `npm run build` hook payloads through `post_tool_use.py --agent codex` and `post_tool_use.py --agent claude`, followed by `stop_summary.py`.
- Result: Passed. Runtime observations and stop summaries were written, and sample `SESSDATA` / `bili_jct` values were redacted.
- Area: PostToolUse and Stop hook scripts.
- Caveat: Synthetic payloads verify the parser and storage path, not every possible hook payload field.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript project baseline after hook configuration.
- Caveat: `npm test` is still a stub until the real test baseline is added.

- Command: `python .\.codex\scripts\context_budget.py`
- Result: Passed and wrote `docs/agent-memory/context-budget-report.md`.
- Area: ECC-inspired context budget audit.
- Caveat: Token counts are estimates based on local file sizes.

- Command: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codex/hooks.json','utf8')); JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.claude/settings.local.json','utf8')); console.log('all hook json ok')"`
- Result: Passed after adding `PreCompact`.
- Area: Claude Code and Codex app hook JSON configuration.
- Caveat: Codex app may still require trust confirmation for changed hooks.

- Command: `'{\"event\":\"PreCompact\"}' | python .\.codex\scripts\pre_compact.py --agent codex` and `'{\"event\":\"PreCompact\"}' | python .\.codex\scripts\pre_compact.py --agent claude`
- Result: Passed and wrote pre-compact checkpoints for both agents.
- Area: PreCompact checkpointing.
- Caveat: Synthetic payload verifies script behavior, not the external app trigger.

- Command: Synthetic failed `npm run build` hook payloads through `post_tool_use.py --agent codex` and `post_tool_use.py --agent claude`.
- Result: Passed. Candidate rows include `candidate_id`, `scope`, `evidence_count`, `confidence`, and `promote_after_review`; sample secret fields were redacted.
- Area: Candidate scoring.
- Caveat: Confidence is a review signal only and does not auto-promote formal memory.

- Command: `python .\.codex\scripts\stop_summary.py --agent codex` and `python .\.codex\scripts\stop_summary.py --agent claude`
- Result: Passed and wrote strategic compact advice into both stop summaries.
- Area: Strategic compact reminders.
- Caveat: The reminder does not run compaction automatically.

- Command: `python .\.codex\scripts\generate_learning_proposals.py --source manual`
- Result: Passed and wrote `docs/agent-memory/pending-learning-proposals.md`.
- Area: Automated controlled learning proposal generation.
- Caveat: The file is a review queue only and does not promote entries into formal memory.

- Command: Task 1 local credential cleanup - replaced hard-coded `SESSDATA`, `bili_jct`, `DedeUserID` in `get_subtitle.py` with `os.environ.get()`.
- Result: Passed. Credential literal scan returned `found: []`. `git status --short --ignored get_subtitle.py` confirmed `!! get_subtitle.py` (git-ignored).
- Area: Stabilization roadmap Task 1.
- Caveat: `get_subtitle.py` is an ignored local debug script; this is a local-only cleanup with no repository-tracked diff.

## 2026-05-28 Task 6 Final Baseline Verification

- Command: `git status --short`
- Result: Expected changes only. M .gitignore, M .npmignore, M package-lock.json, M package.json, D smithery.json, D smithery.yaml, D src/smithery-test.ts. Untracked: .claude/, .codex/, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/, tests/.
- Area: Stabilization final baseline.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 3 test files, 45 tests (vitest v3.2.4, Node >=18 compatible).
- Area: Real test baseline.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 74 files, 552.9 kB. Package includes dist/index.js, dist/index.d.ts, dist/cli.js. Excludes dist/debug_subtitle2.mjs, dist/smithery-test.*, tests/, smithery.json, smithery.yaml, .env files.
- Area: Package contents.

- Command: Package metadata check
- Result: main=dist/index.js, module=dist/index.js, types=dist/index.d.ts, bin.bilibili-mcp=dist/cli.js, type=module. All correct.
- Area: Package entry points.

- Command: Smithery removal check
- Result: dev (undefined), build:smithery (undefined), @smithery/cli (undefined). Fully removed.
- Area: Smithery runtime cleanup.

- Remaining non-blocking risks:
  - Old Bilibili Cookie values were present in repository history and should be rotated.
  - `get_subtitle.py` is local-only cleanup (git-ignored), not a tracked fix.
  - `dist/server.cjs/` bundle (1.7MB) may warrant review but is outside stabilization scope.
  - npm audit: 23 vulnerabilities not introduced or fixed by stabilization changes.

## 2026-05-28 Hook And Memory Health Check

- Command: `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.codex/hooks.json','utf8')); JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.claude/settings.local.json','utf8')); console.log('hook config json ok')"`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Codex and Claude Code hook configuration.
- Caveat: This validates JSON syntax, not external app trust prompts.

- Command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\.codex\scripts\session-start.ps1`
- Result: Passed with exit code 0 and printed bounded project context.
- Area: SessionStart hook.
- Caveat: A previous piped preview using `Select-Object -First` returned exit code 1 because the output pipe was closed early; the direct command passed.

- Command: `post_tool_use.py`, `pre_compact.py`, `stop_summary.py`, and `generate_learning_proposals.py` synthetic health checks for both `codex` and `claude`.
- Result: Passed. File artifacts were written, secret-like sample values were redacted, and stdout returned JSON `{"suppressOutput": true}` for write-file hooks.
- Area: Runtime observations, pre-compact checkpoints, stop summaries, and controlled learning proposal generation.
- Caveat: Synthetic failure observations are ignored by learning proposal generation and should not be promoted as lessons.

- Command: `python .\.codex\scripts\generate_learning_proposals.py --source claude`
- Result: Passed. `docs/agent-memory/pending-learning-proposals.md` currently has no proposals.
- Area: Controlled learning.
- Caveat: No proposal means the learning pipeline is functioning but has no approved durable lesson to promote from runtime candidates.

## 2026-05-28 Phase 2 Task 1-2 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/bilibili-video-api.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 1 test file, 3 tests.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 1 subtitle API behavior baseline and Task 2 WBI extraction regression check.
- Caveat: Tests use mocked fetch and do not call live Bilibili APIs.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 4 test files, 48 tests.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 1 full test verification after adding API-level subtitle tests.
- Caveat: API behavior coverage currently focuses on subtitle fallback and subtitle content URL normalization.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed after extracting WBI signing into `src/bilibili/wbi.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 2 TypeScript and Node ESM compatibility.
- Caveat: PowerShell displayed mojibake for Chinese comments, but Python UTF-8 reads showed `wbi.ts` content is valid UTF-8.

- Command: `npm test -- tests/bilibili-video-api.test.ts`
- Result: Passed after extracting buvid fingerprint handling into `src/bilibili/fingerprint.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 3 subtitle fallback regression check.
- Caveat: Tests use mocked fetch and do not call live Bilibili APIs.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed after extracting buvid fingerprint handling into `src/bilibili/fingerprint.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 3 TypeScript and Node ESM compatibility.
- Caveat: PowerShell displayed mojibake for Chinese comments, but Python UTF-8 reads showed `fingerprint.ts` content is valid UTF-8.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 4 test files, 48 tests after extracting HTTP helpers into `src/bilibili/http.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 4 full regression check.
- Caveat: Tests use mocked fetch for subtitle API behavior and do not call live Bilibili APIs.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed after extracting HTTP helpers into `src/bilibili/http.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 4 TypeScript and Node ESM compatibility.
- Caveat: `retryableFetch` and `throttledFetch` are temporarily exported because `getSubtitleContent()` still lives in `client.ts`; Task 5 should move that consumer into `video-api.ts`.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 4 test files, 48 tests after extracting video and subtitle API functions into `src/bilibili/video-api.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 5 full regression check.
- Caveat: Subtitle API tests use mocked fetch and do not call live Bilibili APIs.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed after extracting video and subtitle API functions into `src/bilibili/video-api.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 5 TypeScript and Node ESM compatibility.
- Caveat: `client.ts` still contains comments API logic until Task 6.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 4 test files, 48 tests after extracting comments API logic into `src/bilibili/comments-api.ts`.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 6 full regression check.
- Caveat: Existing automated tests do not directly exercise comments API fallback behavior.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed after converting `src/bilibili/client.ts` to compatibility re-exports.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 6 and Task 7 TypeScript and Node ESM compatibility.
- Caveat: Public export compatibility was also checked through built `dist/bilibili/client.js`.

- Command: `node -e "import('./dist/bilibili/client.js').then(...)"`
- Result: Passed. `checkLoginStatus`, `fetchWithWBI`, `fetchWithoutWBI`, `getVideoInfo`, `getVideoSubtitle`, `getSubtitleContent`, and `getVideoComments` are all functions.
- Area: Phase 2 Task 7 compatibility exports.
- Caveat: This verifies export presence, not live Bilibili API behavior.

## 2026-05-28 Phase 2 Final Verification

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Final Phase 2 TypeScript compilation.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 4 test files, 48 tests.
- Area: Final Phase 2 regression suite.
- Caveat: Comments API fallback behavior remains a residual untested path.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 94 files, 554.9 kB. Package includes `dist/bilibili/client.*`, `http.*`, `wbi.*`, `fingerprint.*`, `video-api.*`, and `comments-api.*`.
- Area: Final Phase 2 package contents.
- Caveat: `dist/server.cjs/index.cjs.map` remains large but unchanged from the stabilization-era residual risk.

- Command: `node -e "import('./dist/bilibili/client.js').then(...)"`
- Result: Passed. All 7 compatibility exports are functions.
- Area: Final Phase 2 public import compatibility.

- Command: `git status --short`
- Result: Phase 2 files are present alongside pre-existing agent/hooks and memory/doc changes.
- Area: Final Phase 2 worktree scope.
- Caveat: Agent/hooks configuration changes are still unrelated to the code split and should be committed separately if the user wants separate history.

## 2026-05-28 Active Plan Tracking Verification

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`
- Result: Returned `docs\superpowers\plans\2026-05-28-mcp-tool-surface-implementation-plan.md`.
- Area: Controlled learning active-plan resolution.
- Caveat: The tracker chooses the first incomplete implementation plan in project roadmap order and preserves an already-active incomplete plan.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source codex` and `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source claude`
- Result: Passed. Both Codex and Claude runtime `learning-proposal-phase-state.json` files now point at `2026-05-28-mcp-tool-surface-implementation-plan.md` with completed count `0`.
- Area: Phase-gated learning proposal reminders.
- Caveat: No learning proposal is generated unless runtime candidates meet the promotion threshold.

- Command: Synthetic PreCompact payload through `pre_compact.py --agent codex`
- Result: Passed. The pre-compact checkpoint now records the Phase 3 MCP tool surface implementation plan as the active roadmap.
- Area: PreCompact checkpointing.
- Caveat: Synthetic payload verifies script behavior, not the external app trigger.

## 2026-05-28 Phase 3 Task 1 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/server-tools.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 1 test file, 8 passed tests, 2 todo tests for planned Phase 3 tools.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 1 MCP tool surface baseline.
- Caveat: The test invokes the registered `tools/list` handler through the MCP SDK server's internal `_requestHandlers` map. This avoids starting stdio transport, but may need adjustment if the SDK internal shape changes.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 5 test files, 56 passed tests, 2 todo tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 1 full regression suite.
- Caveat: The 2 todo tests intentionally represent future `get_video_transcript` and `get_video_metadata` schema assertions.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 1 TypeScript compilation.

## 2026-05-28 Phase 3 Task 2 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/validation.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 30 validation tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 2 comment option validation.
- Caveat: `validateCommentSort("")` was initially accepted as falsy and then corrected to throw; `undefined` remains the only absent-value pass-through.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 5 test files, 69 passed tests, 2 todo tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 2 full regression suite.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 2 TypeScript compilation.

## 2026-05-28 Phase 3 Task 3 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 12 comment wrapper tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 3 comment wrapper option controls.
- Caveat: The first test version introduced mojibake in test descriptions/comments; this was corrected and verified with `rg -n "鈥|鈫|�|—|→" tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts` returning no matches.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 6 test files, 81 passed tests, 2 todo tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 3 full regression suite.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 3 TypeScript compilation.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 3 Task 4 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/bilibili-metadata.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 8 metadata wrapper tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 4 metadata-only wrapper.
- Caveat: Tests mock `getVideoInfo()` and do not call live Bilibili APIs.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 7 test files, 89 passed tests, 2 todo tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 4 full regression suite.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 4 TypeScript compilation.

- Command: `rg -n "鈥|鈫|�|—|→" src/bilibili/metadata.ts src/bilibili/types.ts tests/bilibili-metadata.test.ts`
- Result: No matches.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 4 encoding check.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 3 Task 5 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 12 transcript wrapper tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 5 transcript-only wrapper.
- Caveat: Tests mock `getVideoInfo()`, `getVideoSubtitle()`, and `getSubtitleContent()` and do not call live Bilibili APIs.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 101 passed tests, 2 todo tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 5 full regression suite.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 5 TypeScript compilation.

- Command: `git diff -- src/bilibili/subtitle.ts tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts src/bilibili/types.ts | Select-String -Pattern "→|—|鈥|鈫|�" -Context 1,1`
- Result: No output after replacing two newly added `→` arrows with `->`.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 5 new-content encoding check.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 3 Task 6 Verification

- Command: `npm test -- tests/server-tools.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 17 MCP tool schema tests, 0 todo tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 6 MCP tool registration baseline.
- Caveat: These tests use the MCP SDK server's internal `_requestHandlers` map to inspect the `tools/list` response. Handler behavior is mostly covered through service-wrapper tests rather than direct MCP handler mocks.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 6 full regression suite.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 6 TypeScript compilation and MCP server imports.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files, 559.4 kB. Package includes updated `dist/server.*`, `dist/bilibili/metadata.*`, and Phase 3 wrapper outputs. No tests, `.env`, Smithery, or debug artifacts were reported in the tarball contents.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 6 package contents.

- Command: `bad-character scan for mojibake markers, replacement characters, em dash, and arrow in src/server.ts and tests/server-tools.test.ts`
- Result: No matches.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 6 new server/test encoding check.

- Result: Passed.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 7 TypeScript compilation after updating `src/server.ts` schema descriptions.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files, 560.1 kB. Package includes updated `README.md`, `README_EN.md`, and built `dist/server.*`.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 7 package contents.

- Command: `rg -n "detailed.*50|50.*detailed|前50|50 popular|#3-.*稳健性|#3-.*robustness" README.md README_EN.md src/server.ts`
- Result: No matches after review correction.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 7 stale documentation scan.

- Command: `git diff -U0 -- README.md README_EN.md src/server.ts | rg -n "^\\+.*(mojibake markers|replacement characters|em dash|arrow)"`
- Result: No matches for newly added bad characters. A full-file scan still matches pre-existing README Issue-contact punctuation outside the Phase 3 additions.
- Area: Phase 3 Task 7 new-content encoding check.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 3 Final Verification (Task 8)

- Command: `git status --short`
- Result: Expected changes — 14 modified (source, tests, docs, READMEs, config), 9 new untracked (plan/spec docs, new source modules, new test files). No unexpected artifacts.
- Area: Phase 3 final baseline.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation with new MCP schemas and service wrappers.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests, 0 todo. All new wrapper tests pass. All existing tests pass (no regressions).
- Area: Phase 3 tool surface test baseline.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files, 560.1 kB. Package includes new modules (metadata.ts, expanded server.ts). Excludes tests/, .env, Smithery artifacts, debug artifacts.
- Area: Package contents.

- Command: Contaminant scan (`smithery-test`, `debug_subtitle2`, `detailed=50` stale text)
- Result: Zero stale detailed=50 matches. Zero debug/Smithery artifacts in package. Only intentional `.npmignore` rule references `dist/smithery-test.*`.
- Area: Documentation and package hygiene.

- Command: Mojibake scan (new files and modified source/docs)
- Result: No new mojibake introduced. Pre-existing mojibake in `verification-log.md` (not Phase 3 scope).
- Area: Encoding check.

- Final tool list: `get_video_info` (unchanged), `get_video_comments` (expanded with limit/sort/include_replies), `get_video_transcript` (new), `get_video_metadata` (new).
- Phase 3 plan: Tasks 1-8 all marked complete.
- Remaining risks: No stdio-level MCP handler integration tests (wrapper behavior covered by unit tests). npm audit 23 vulnerabilities not introduced by Phase 3.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Task 1 Public Surface Inspection

- Command: `git status --short`
- Result: Clean after removing generated `__pycache__/`.
- Area: Phase 4 Task 1 read-only inspection baseline.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: Release-polish baseline.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files.
- Area: Package contents baseline.

- Finding: Actual MCP tool surface is `get_video_info`, `get_video_comments`, `get_video_transcript`, and `get_video_metadata`.
- Finding: `README.md` and `README_EN.md` already document all four tools and the expanded comment parameters.
- Finding: `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG_EN.md` are missing a v1.3.8 entry for stabilization, client split, MCP tool expansion, Smithery removal, tests, and package cleanup.
- Finding: `package.json` metadata is publishable but description and keywords do not yet mention transcript and metadata.
- Finding: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` exists and appears to use trusted publishing/provenance, but lacks an `npm test` step before publish. Official docs verification is deferred to Phase 4 Task 5.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Task 2 README Documentation Verification

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: README documentation update regression check.

- Area: Package contents check.

- Command: `rg -n '区分”|与”|鈥|鈫|�' README.md README_EN.md`
- Result: No matches after correcting the README Chinese quote pairing.
- Area: README encoding and typography check.

- Finding: README files now document no-cookie limitations, Cookie-backed credential sources, and caller behavior for `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `COOKIE_EXPIRED`, and `SUBTITLE_UNAVAILABLE`.
- Finding: Review follow-up fixed README TOC anchor drift for the behavior/error section and restored the environment requirements anchor.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Task 3 Changelog Verification

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: Changelog update regression check.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation after changelog-only changes.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files.
- Area: Package contents check.

- Command: `rg -n "hard-coded|硬编码|source code|源码|npm publish|GitHub release|tag pushed|SESSDATA=|bili_jct=|DedeUserID=|npm_[A-Za-z0-9]|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]|鈥|鈫|�" CHANGELOG.md CHANGELOG_EN.md`
- Result: No matches after review correction.
- Area: Changelog overclaim, secret, and bad-character scan.

- Finding: `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG_EN.md` now include a 1.3.8 section for Phase 1 stabilization, Phase 2 client split, Phase 3 MCP tool expansion, Smithery removal, Vitest baseline, package cleanup, and README updates.
- Finding: Credential-hardening wording avoids claiming npm publication, GitHub release/tag creation, or tracked source credential removal.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Task 4 Package Metadata Verification

- Command: `node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); ..."`
- Result: Confirmed publish-critical fields unchanged: name `@xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp`, version `1.3.8`, `main`/`module` `dist/index.js`, `types` `dist/index.d.ts`, `bin.bilibili-mcp` `dist/cli.js`, `files` `[dist, README.md, README_EN.md, LICENSE]`, Node engine `>=18.0.0`.
- Area: Package metadata inspection.

- Command: `git diff -- package.json package-lock.json`
- Result: Only `package.json` description and keywords changed. `package-lock.json` unchanged.
- Area: Metadata diff review.

- Command: `rg -n "smithery|Smithery|debug_subtitle2|SESSDATA=|bili_jct=|DedeUserID=|npm_[A-Za-z0-9]|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]" package.json package-lock.json`
- Result: No matches.
- Area: Package metadata secret and stale artifact scan.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: Package metadata regression check.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation after metadata-only changes.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files.
- Area: Package contents check.

- Finding: Description now mentions video metadata, transcripts, subtitles, and comment summarization.
- Finding: Keywords now include `transcript` and `metadata`.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Task 5 Publish Workflow Verification

- Official docs checked: npm Trusted Publishers, npm provenance statements, GitHub Actions workflow syntax permissions, and GitHub Publishing Node.js packages documentation.
- Result: Trusted publishing requires npm CLI `11.5.1+` and Node `22.14.0+`; `id-token: write` is required for OIDC; `contents: read` is sufficient repository read permission; `registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/` is required for npm publishing setup.
- Area: Publish workflow documentation freshness.

- Command: `git diff -- .github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Result: Workflow now uses Node `22.14.0`, keeps `id-token: write` and `contents: read`, keeps npm registry setup, installs npm latest for trusted publishing support, runs `npm test` after `npm ci`, and keeps `npm publish --provenance --access public`.
- Area: Publish workflow diff review.

- Command: local YAML parse with PyYAML.
- Result: Parsed steps and permissions correctly. Caveat: PyYAML YAML 1.1 parsed the `on` key as boolean `True`; this is a local parser quirk and not a GitHub Actions syntax issue.
- Area: Workflow syntax sanity check.

- Command: `rg -n "NPM_TOKEN|NODE_AUTH_TOKEN|npm_[A-Za-z0-9]|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]|smithery|Smithery|鈥|鈫|�" .github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Result: No matches.
- Area: Workflow token, Smithery, and bad-character scan.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: Publish workflow update regression check.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation after workflow-only changes.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files.
- Area: Package contents check.

- Finding: Workflow remains tag-triggered for `v*.*.*` and manually runnable via `workflow_dispatch`. No publish, tag, or release was performed.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Task 6 Secret And Package Content Verification

- Command: secret scan over README files, changelogs, `package.json`, publish workflow, release-polish plan, and verification log.
- Result: Matches were limited to verification-log scan commands, plan placeholders such as `BILIBILI_SESSDATA=your_sessdata`, and plan checklist patterns such as `SESSDATA=...`; no real Cookie, npm token, or GitHub token values were found.
- Area: Secret scan.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files. Included expected `package.json`, `README.md`, `README_EN.md`, `LICENSE`, `dist/index.js`, `dist/index.d.ts`, `dist/cli.js`, `dist/server.js`, and Bilibili dist modules.
- Area: Package contents.

- Finding: Tarball excludes tests, `.env`, local debug scripts, Smithery artifacts, `.claude`, `.codex`, `docs/agent-memory`, and runtime cache files.
- Finding: Hygiene scan hits for `.env`, `.codex`, `.claude`, `smithery-test`, and Smithery were documentation references or `.npmignore` exclusion rules, not package contents.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests.
- Area: Security/package review regression check.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Final Verification (Task 7)

- Command: `git status --short`
- Result: Expected Phase 4 changes only (READMEs, changelogs, package.json, publish.yml, plan doc, verification log). No unexpected artifacts.
- Area: Phase 4 final baseline.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript compilation.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 8 test files, 110 tests, 0 todo.
- Area: Phase 4 release polish test baseline.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. 98 files. Includes all expected dist and docs. Excludes tests/, .env, debug artifacts, Smithery artifacts, .claude/, .codex/, docs/agent-memory/.
- Area: Package contents.

- Command: Schema alignment scan (all 4 tools in READMEs and server.ts)
- Result: Confirmed. get_video_info, get_video_comments, get_video_transcript, get_video_metadata all present with correct params.
- Area: Documentation alignment.

- Command: Stale text scan (detailed=50, overclaims, hard-coded source code removal)
- Result: Only legitimate security best-practice warnings in READMEs ("Never hard-code Cookie values"). Changelogs clean. No overclaims.
- Area: Documentation accuracy.

- Command: Secret scan (NPM_TOKEN, NODE_AUTH_TOKEN, real tokens)
- Result: Zero matches in all Phase 4 files.
- Area: Security review.

- Command: Bad-char scan (Phase 4 files)
- Result: All clean.
- Area: Encoding review.

- Phase 4 plan: Tasks 1-7 all marked complete.
- Remaining risks: No publish/tag/release has been performed. Trusted publishing OIDC setup on npm side must be configured before first publish. Workflow uses `npm install -g npm@latest` which is a moving target on CI.

## 2026-06-04 Learning Sedimentation Review

- Command: `Select-String -Path docs/agent-memory/verification-log.md -Pattern 'Phase 2|Phase 3|learning|hook|proposal|plan' -Context 1,3`
- Result: Confirmed formal verification memory exists for Phase 2 final verification, Phase 3 Task 1-8 verification, and active-plan tracking.
- Area: Project memory completeness.

- Command: `Get-Content docs/agent-memory/pending-learning-proposals.md`
- Result: Current generated queue reports `No Proposals`.
- Area: Controlled learning proposal state.
- Caveat: This means no runtime candidate currently meets the promotion threshold; it does not mean the learning pipeline failed.

- Command: `Get-Content .claude/runtime/learning-proposal-phase-state.json` and `Get-Content C:\Users\ZX\.codex\memories\bilibili-mcp\runtime\learning-proposal-phase-state.json`
- Result: Both Claude and Codex runtime state files exist and currently point at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-agent-memory-learning-system.md`.
- Area: Agent runtime learning state.
- Caveat: The current active plan differs from Phase 2/3 because `plan_tracker.py` selects the first incomplete plan.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`
- Result: Returned `docs\superpowers\plans\2026-05-27-agent-memory-learning-system.md`.
- Area: Active-plan tracking.
- Caveat: Future phase-gated learning reminders should confirm this is the intended active plan before relying on reminder timing.

- Formal memory updates: added 2026-06-04 entries to `project-facts.md` and `lessons-learned.md`.
- Conclusion: Phase 2/3 memory capture worked. Controlled learning operated as review-gated proposal generation, and no automatic promotion occurred because no proposal currently met the threshold.

## 2026-06-04 Active Plan Tracker Drift Fix

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`
- Result: Returned `docs\superpowers\plans\2026-05-28-documentation-release-polish-implementation-plan.md`.
- Area: Active-plan resolution.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source codex` and `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source claude`
- Result: Passed with JSON-safe stdout `{"suppressOutput": true}`.
- Area: Controlled learning runtime state refresh.

- Command: `Get-Content C:\Users\ZX\.codex\memories\bilibili-mcp\runtime\learning-proposal-phase-state.json` and `Get-Content .claude\runtime\learning-proposal-phase-state.json`
- Result: Both state files now point at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-28-documentation-release-polish-implementation-plan.md` with `completed_phase_count` 7.
- Area: Codex and Claude Code learning state.

- Command: Python UTF-8 read of `docs/agent-memory/pending-learning-proposals.md` approval phrase line.
- Result: File content is `Approval phrase: `批准本轮 learning proposals`.`. PowerShell may display this line as mojibake, but the file itself is valid UTF-8.
- Area: Encoding check.

- Change: `.codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py` now filters candidate plans and previous active plans to the stabilization roadmap or `*-implementation-plan.md` files.
- Conclusion: The active-plan drift is fixed. Non-implementation plans such as `2026-05-27-agent-memory-learning-system.md` and `2026-05-28-agent-hooks.md` no longer take over phase-gated learning reminders.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 4 Learning Sedimentation

- Source reviewed: Phase 4 verification entries in `docs/agent-memory/verification-log.md` and the Phase 4 final commit report.
- Result: Added formal memory entries for Phase 4 release-polish lessons and current release status.
- Area: Project learning sedimentation.

- Fact promoted: Phase 4 completed source-level documentation and release workflow polish, but no tag, GitHub release, or npm publish has been performed.
- Lesson promoted: npm trusted publishing and GitHub Actions OIDC guidance must be refreshed from official docs when workflow behavior is touched.
- Lesson promoted: A publish workflow update is not a release execution; release execution needs separate gates for trusted publishing setup, final verification, tag push, Actions monitoring, and release notes.
- Lesson promoted: `npm install -g npm@latest` is a moving CI target even though it was kept in Phase 4 for trusted publishing compatibility.

- Files updated: `project-facts.md`, `lessons-learned.md`, and `verification-log.md`.
- Conclusion: Phase 4 now has both verification memory and explicit reusable learning entries.

## 2026-06-04 Phase 5 Release Execution Verification

- Command: `git tag --list v1.4.0`, `git ls-remote --tags origin v1.4.0`, and `git show --no-patch --pretty=fuller v1.4.0`
- Result: Annotated tag `v1.4.0` exists locally and remotely. The tag targets commit `021a2a1f96fcbac30d5c4bcc030cd0212a6b7130`.
- Area: Release tag verification.

- Command: `gh run list --workflow publish.yml --limit 1`
- Result: Latest publish workflow run completed successfully for `v1.4.0`, event `push`, run id `26944676803`, duration 38s, created `2026-06-04T09:57:32Z`.
- Area: GitHub Actions publish workflow.
- Caveat: `gh run view 26944676803 --json ...` returned an API EOF once, but `gh run list` and npm registry metadata both confirmed success.

- Command: `npm view @xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@1.4.0 name version description keywords gitHead dist-tags time --json`
- Result: npm registry shows `@xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@1.4.0`, `latest` dist-tag points to `1.4.0`, description includes metadata/transcripts/subtitles/comment summarization, keywords include `transcript` and `metadata`, and `gitHead` is `021a2a1f96fcbac30d5c4bcc030cd0212a6b7130`.
- Area: npm publication verification.

- Command: `npm view @xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp version dist-tags gitHead --json`
- Result: npm registry reports version `1.4.0`, `latest: 1.4.0`, and gitHead `021a2a1f96fcbac30d5c4bcc030cd0212a6b7130`.
- Area: Post-publish package state.

- Previous recovery context: `v1.3.8` was already present on npm from 2026-03-11 and did not represent the current Phase 1-5 code. The current release was retargeted to `v1.4.0`; `v1.3.8` tag remains preserved for forensic trace and should not be deleted without explicit user approval.
- Remaining release step: GitHub Release for `v1.4.0` has not been created yet.

## 2026-06-05 Credential Guidance Verification

- Scope: Agent-facing Bilibili Cookie setup guidance for MCP clients and credential-dependent tools.
- Result: Added MCP tools for setup instructions and credential status, added credential `next_steps` to relevant error paths, and updated tool descriptions so agents can discover the credential dependency.
- Area: MCP tool surface and credential UX.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed with 11 test files and 122 tests.
- Area: Unit and server tool regression tests.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript build.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed. Dry-run package contents include the generated `dist/utils/credential-guidance.*` files.
- Area: Package contents.

- Command: `git diff --check`
- Result: Passed with only line-ending warnings.
- Area: Patch hygiene.

- Command: Secret and stale-client scan over README, source, and tests for Cookie assignment patterns and unsupported client names.
- Result: No real Cookie values found; README no longer contains Coze, Langcli, MiniMax, Mavis, or Kimi Work setup sections.
- Area: Credential safety and documentation cleanup.

- Review finding fixed: The generic `src/server.ts` catch path initially omitted structured `code` and `next_steps` for `BilibiliAPIError("COOKIE_EXPIRED")`; Codex added the fix and `tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts`.
- Remaining caveat: `getCredentialSource()` reports `env`, `global_config`, or `none`; it does not currently report in-memory-only credentials.

## 2026-06-05 Agent Memory And Learning System Health Check

- Command: JSON parse of `.codex/hooks.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- Result: Both parsed successfully.
- Area: Codex and Claude Code hook configuration.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`
- Result: Returned `docs\superpowers\plans\2026-06-04-release-execution-implementation-plan.md`.
- Area: Active-plan tracking.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/context_budget.py`
- Result: Passed and refreshed `docs/agent-memory/context-budget-report.md`.
- Area: Context budget reporting.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source claude` and `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source codex`.
- Result: Both passed with JSON-safe stdout `{"suppressOutput": true}`.
- Area: Controlled learning proposal generation.

- Runtime state: Codex runtime files exist under `C:\Users\ZX\.codex\memories\bilibili-mcp\`; Claude runtime files exist under `.claude\memory\` and `.claude\runtime\`.
- Result: Both sides had stop summaries and learning phase state updated on 2026-06-05.
- Area: Runtime observation storage.

- Conclusion: The Codex and Claude Code memory/learning systems are operational. Current `pending-learning-proposals.md` reports no proposals above threshold, which is a normal controlled-learning state rather than a failure.

## 2026-06-14 Active Plan Sync

- Command: `gh release view v1.4.0 --json tagName,name,url,publishedAt,isDraft,isPrerelease`
- Result: GitHub Release `v1.4.0` exists, is not draft or prerelease, and was published at `2026-06-04T10:02:43Z`.
- Area: Release execution plan synchronization.

- Command: `gh release view v1.4.0 --json body --jq .body`
- Result: Release notes mention the new transcript and metadata tools, expanded comment controls, client module split, Smithery removal, 110-test baseline, and npm package link.
- Area: GitHub Release acceptance criteria.

- Command: `npm test -- tests/credential-guidance.test.ts tests/server-credential-tools.test.ts tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts tests/server-tools.test.ts`
- Result: Passed. 4 test files, 29 tests.
- Area: Credential guidance focused regression.
- Caveat: The no-credential tests now hide the local global credential config so a developer machine with configured Cookies does not contaminate the `source: none` branch.

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: Passed. 12 test files, 125 tests.
- Area: Full regression suite after active-plan synchronization.

- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Passed.
- Area: TypeScript build after active-plan synchronization.

- Command: `npm pack --dry-run`
- Result: Passed for `@xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@1.4.6`, 102 files.
- Area: Package contents sanity check.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`
- Result: Returned `docs\superpowers\plans\2026-06-05-credential-guidance-mcp-tools-implementation-plan.md`.
- Area: Active-plan tracking.

- Command: `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source codex` and `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source claude`
- Result: Both passed with JSON-safe stdout `{"suppressOutput": true}`; both runtime `learning-proposal-phase-state.json` files now point to the credential guidance implementation plan with `completed_phase_count` 8.
- Area: Codex and Claude Code learning proposal state.

- Change: Marked completed/verified checkboxes in the release execution and credential guidance implementation plans so phase-gated reminders no longer treat old release work as active.
- Conclusion: Active plan tracking and both Codex/Claude learning states are synchronized to the latest completed implementation plan. `pending-learning-proposals.md` still reports no proposals above threshold, which is expected.

## 2026-06-14 Task 1 Package Dependency Health

- Commands: `npm audit --json`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; `npm pack --dry-run`; package/workflow secret scan with `rg`.
- Result: `package-lock.json` root version matches `package.json` version `1.4.6`, `esbuild` is outside the audited vulnerable range, tests/build/package dry-run pass, and no package-surface secret leak was found.
- Caveat: No npm publish, tag, push, or GitHub release was performed.

## 2026-06-14 Task 2 Logging Debug Output Cleanup

- Commands: `npm test -- tests/logger-redaction.test.ts tests/bilibili-video-api.test.ts tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; logger debug smoke check; logging and secret scans with `rg`.
- Result: Debug logs are silent unless `BILIBILI_MCP_DEBUG=1`, debug output remains redacted when enabled, Bilibili API diagnostics route through the redacting logger, tests/build pass, and no real credential value was found.
- Caveat: No MCP tool contract, credential loading behavior, package metadata, tag, push, publish, or GitHub release was changed.

## 2026-06-14 Task 3 MCP Server Handler Refactor

- Commands: `npm test -- tests/server-tools.test.ts tests/server-credential-tools.test.ts tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts tests/server-handler-sanitization.test.ts`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; server contract scan with `rg`.
- Result: `src/server.ts` now only constructs/registers the MCP server, tool schemas and handlers are extracted, public tool order/schema/error contracts remain covered by tests, sanitized inputs are passed downstream without changing URL-to-BVID extraction ownership, and tests/build pass.
- Caveat: No MCP tool was added, removed, renamed, or intentionally changed; no package, README, credential loading, release, tag, push, or publish action was performed.

## 2026-06-14 Task 4 Type And Cache Hardening

- Commands: `npm test -- tests/cache.test.ts tests/bilibili-metadata.test.ts tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; type-hardening scan with `rg`.
- Result: `CacheManager` now uses generic value types and preserves cache key/stat behavior, selected Bilibili wrapper casts are replaced with typed response interfaces, focused behavior tests and full tests/build pass.
- Caveat: No cache key format, MCP public contract, credential loading, logging behavior, source encoding, package metadata, tag, push, publish, or GitHub release was changed.

## 2026-06-14 Active Plan Tracker Commit-Boundary Fix

- Commands: `python .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py`; `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source codex`; `python .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py --source claude`; `python -m py_compile .codex/scripts/plan_tracker.py .codex/scripts/generate_learning_proposals.py`.
- Result: Active plan tracking now ignores unchecked commit-boundary steps that require explicit user approval, so Task 1 no longer blocks phase-gated learning after implementation verification is complete. Codex and Claude runtime phase state both point to `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-14-task3-mcp-server-handler-refactor-implementation-plan.md` with completed phase count 6.
- Caveat: This does not mark a commit as completed and does not stage, commit, push, or modify Task 3 source behavior.

## 2026-06-15 Task 5 Source Comment And Metadata Encoding Cleanup

- Commands: UTF-8 source/metadata scan with Python; `node -e` package metadata check; `npm run build`; `npm test`; behavior-neutral diff review.
- Result: Scoped source comments and package metadata were verified as clean UTF-8 or already acceptable; no source or package metadata cleanup was required.
- Caveat: PowerShell terminal mojibake was not treated as file corruption; only UTF-8 file reads were used for encoding judgment.

## 2026-06-15 Task 6 MCP Integration Test Hardening

- Commands: `npm run build`; `npm test -- tests/server-tools.test.ts tests/server-credential-tools.test.ts tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts tests/server-handler-sanitization.test.ts tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts`; `npm test`; `npm pack --dry-run`; MCP test helper scan with `rg`.
- Result: MCP server tests now share a single registered-handler helper, stdio entrypoint smoke coverage verifies startup logging stays on stderr, public tool-list smoke coverage remains stable, and build/tests/package dry-run pass.
- Caveat: One Task 6 scoped exception — `src/index.ts:16` now passes `quiet: true` to dotenv to stop dotenv 17 from polluting MCP stdio stdout with `[dotenv@...] injecting env` log; without this 1-line production fix the stdio smoke `stdout === ""` assertion cannot pass and real MCP clients would see non-JSON output on the JSON-RPC channel. No MCP public contract, credential loading, logger behavior, cache behavior, package metadata, release workflow, tag, push, publish, or GitHub release was changed.

## 2026-06-18 MCP Update Guidance

- Commands: `npm run build`; `npm test -- tests/update-check.test.ts tests/server-tools.test.ts tests/server-credential-tools.test.ts tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts tests/credential-guidance.test.ts tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts`; `npm test`; `node dist/cli.js check-update`; `npm pack --dry-run`; stale unversioned command scan with `rg --pcre2`.
- Result: Added explicit package freshness guidance through `check_mcp_update` and `bilibili-mcp check-update`; README and README_EN now prefer `npx -y @xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@latest` for MCP configs and credential helper commands; build, focused tests, full tests, real CLI update check, package dry-run, and stale command scan passed.
- Caveat: No automatic package update, npm publish, tag, push, GitHub Release, release workflow change, credential loading change, Bilibili API behavior change, or real MCP client UI smoke was performed.

## 2026-06-18 Version 1.6.0 Commit Verification

- Commands: `npm version 1.6.0 --no-git-tag-version`; `npm run build`; `npm test`; `npm pack --dry-run`; `node dist/cli.js check-update`; `git diff --check`.
- Result: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` now report `1.6.0`; build and full Vitest suite pass; package dry-run reports `@xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@1.6.0`; CLI update check reports local current `1.6.0` against npm latest `1.5.3`; diff check has only CRLF warnings.
- Caveat: No npm publish, tag creation, GitHub Release creation, or release workflow execution was performed in this commit step.

## 2026-06-18 Bilingual MCP Guidance Fields

- Commands: `npm run build`; `npm test -- tests/credential-guidance.test.ts tests/server-credential-tools.test.ts tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts tests/update-check.test.ts`; `npm test`; bilingual field scan with `rg`; added-diff secret-pattern scan with `git diff -- ... | Select-String`.
- Result: Credential setup/status, cookie-expired guidance, subtitle-unavailable guidance, and MCP update checks now keep existing English-compatible fields while adding explicit `*_en` and `*_zh` fields for clients that render either language; README and README_EN document the bilingual fields; build, focused tests, and full Vitest suite pass.
- Caveat: This is a source/documentation change only; no package version bump, tag, release, npm publish, push, credential loading behavior change, or Bilibili network behavior change was performed.

## 2026-06-19 Structured Error Guidance Codex Review

- Commands: `npm test -- tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; structured error-code scan with `rg`; added-diff secret-pattern scan with `git diff -- ... | Select-String`; UTF-8 source check with Python.
- Result: Codex review found and fixed two gaps after Claude implementation: handler-level plain `Error` validation failures now still return `VALIDATION_ERROR`, and generic `BilibiliAPIError("...", "API_ERROR")` now returns the documented `BILIBILI_API_ERROR` while preserving the original token in `details.api_code`. Focused tests now pass at 23 tests, full Vitest suite passes at 16 files / 155 tests, and build passes.
- Caveat: Live MCP client compatibility, npm package dry-run, version bump, tag, release, npm publish, push, and live Bilibili API calls were not performed in this review.

## 2026-06-19 Structured Error Guidance Package Dry Run

- Commands: `npm pack --dry-run --json`; package file scan over the JSON output for `tests`, `docs/qa`, `docs/agent-memory`, `docs/research`, `docs/templates`, `.codex`, `.claude`, `.env`, Smithery files, `src`, and raw `.ts` files excluding expected `.d.ts` type declarations.
- Result: Package dry-run reports `@xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@1.6.1`, `xzxzzx-bilibili-mcp-1.6.1.tgz`, 120 entries, 102709 bytes packed, 389208 bytes unpacked, shasum `bc2dbd3e2c03ee72dde6c2ee503ce601d65870d8`; abnormal file scan returned `badCount=0`.
- Caveat: This is a dry run only; no npm publish, tag, release, push, live MCP client test, or live Bilibili API call was performed.

## 2026-06-19 Structured Error Guidance Stdio Smoke

- Commands: Node child-process stdio smoke against `node dist/index.js` with `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call get_video_info` using an empty `bvid_or_url`.
- Result: Process exited 0; stdout had 3 JSON-RPC response lines and no non-JSON noise; raw stderr was exactly `Bilibili MCP server running on stdio`; `tools/list` returned 7 expected tools; invalid input returned an MCP `isError: true` response whose JSON text payload had `code: VALIDATION_ERROR`, `category: validation`, `message_zh`, `next_steps_zh`, and `next_steps` matching `next_steps_en`.
- Caveat: This is an equivalent local stdio smoke, not a GUI MCP client smoke; no live Bilibili API call, package publish, tag, release, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-19 Version 1.6.3 Publish Verification

- Commands: `npm test`; `npm run build`; `npm pack --dry-run --json`; `git push origin master`; `git push origin v1.6.3`; `gh run watch 27803425317 --repo XZXZZX-Ai/bilibili-mcp --exit-status`; `npm view @xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp version dist-tags --json`; `gh release view v1.6.3`.
- Result: Release commit `ee22eb9` and annotated tag `v1.6.3` were pushed; GitHub Actions run `27803425317` completed successfully through `Publish to npm`; npm registry reports version `1.6.3` and `latest: 1.6.3`; GitHub Release `v1.6.3 - Publish Fix / 发布修复` is published at `https://github.com/XZXZZX-Ai/bilibili-mcp/releases/tag/v1.6.3`.
- Caveat: The previous `v1.6.2` tag and failed workflow were left intact; unrelated local harness and memory working-tree changes remain uncommitted.

## 2026-07-19 Matt Pocock Skills Workflow Integration

- Commands: live GitHub API listing for upstream engineering/productivity skill names; local existence comparison against Codex and Claude Code skill roots; `gh label list`; creation of the four missing default triage labels; UTF-8 replacement-character check; scoped credential-pattern scan; duplicate-heading checks; `git diff --check`; `python .codex/scripts/context_budget.py`.
- Result: All 22 current upstream skill names are present in both runtimes; GitHub Issues, five default triage labels, and a single-context domain-doc layout are configured; all five labels exist remotely; Codex and Claude routing preserve file-backed handoffs and explicit Git authorization; encoding, secret-pattern, duplicate-heading, and diff checks passed.
- Caveat: No GitHub Issue, commit, push, source code, MCP behavior, package metadata, test, release, hook registration, or global skill file was changed. The initial context budget was `HIGH`; the subsequent Superpowers runtime removal reduced the current status to `REVIEW`.

## 2026-07-19 Superpowers Runtime Removal

- Commands: scoped `rg` scans; Python compilation for context-budget, plan-tracker, learning-proposal, and pre-compact scripts; live `plan_tracker.py`; learning proposal regeneration; session-start output check; context budget regeneration; `git diff --check`.
- Result: Current Codex and Claude rules prohibit all `superpowers:*` skills; active work resolves to `docs/agent-memory/active-work.md`; startup, pre-compact, learning-state, and context-budget scripts no longer load `docs/superpowers/`; always-relevant context dropped from `HIGH` 23254 tokens to `REVIEW` 17685 tokens.
- Caveat: Historical files and evidence references under `docs/superpowers/` were intentionally retained. No source code, MCP behavior, package, test, GitHub Issue, label, commit, push, or release state changed in this removal step.

## 2026-07-19 Paseo Claude Code Workflow Integration

- Commands: `Get-Command paseo`; read `C:\Users\ZX\.paseo\orchestration-preferences.json`; `paseo --help`; `paseo run --help`; `GET http://127.0.0.1:6767/api/health`; scoped workflow-rule scans; added-diff UTF-8/secret-value scan; `git diff --check`; `python .codex/scripts/context_budget.py`.
- Result: Paseo CLI resolves to `C:\Users\ZX\.local\bin\paseo.cmd`; the daemon health endpoint returns `status: ok`; the live `providers.impl` preference selects a Claude provider; repository rules now let Codex launch and review one bounded Claude Code implementation agent from a file-backed handoff without user-operated prompt transfer. Workflow checks passed and the context budget remains `REVIEW` at an estimated 18226 tokens.
- Caveat: No Claude implementation agent was launched because no bounded implementation ticket was selected in this workflow-only change. Paseo daemon restart, source changes, tests, package operations, Git commits, pushes, and releases were not performed.

## 2026-07-19 Concurrent HTTP Throttling Fix

- Commands: temporary red-capable `tests/.tmp-http-throttle-repro.test.ts`; `npm test -- tests/bilibili-http.test.ts`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; temporary/debug-file scans; scoped source/test diff review; Paseo-managed Claude implementation and same-scope repair prompts; focused risk review.
- Result: The red repro measured a minimum concurrent request-start gap of about `0.155ms` against a configured `500ms` interval. `throttledFetch` now reserves FIFO admission turns with a normalized promise chain, excludes prior callers' queue time from the current caller's timeout, includes the current caller's own rate-limit wait, and allows response bodies to overlap. Codex independently verified 2/2 focused tests, 157/157 full-suite tests across 17 files, TypeScript build, diff format, and clean concurrency/timeout/recovery/determinism/scope risk findings.
- Caveat: The Paseo `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` subagents did not return promptly; the top-level Claude agent completed their scoped work and Codex stopped the otherwise-finished agent. No real Bilibili network call, package dry run, commit, push, release, or Issue close was performed. GitHub Issue #2 is labeled `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Empty Transcript Credential Detection

- Commands: focused red/green `npm test -- tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts -t "checks login status when an empty subtitle list would otherwise fall back"`; full transcript file; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; debug-marker and scoped-diff review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The red test showed a logged-out empty subtitle list resolving to description instead of rejecting. A private `verifyLoginForEmptySubtitles` helper now holds the existing safe login check and is reused by both transcript and video-info flows. Codex independently verified 1/1 focused, 15/15 transcript, and 158/158 full-suite tests across 17 files; build and diff/debug checks passed; logged-in fallback and `NoSubtitleError` behavior remain covered and unchanged.
- Caveat: No real Bilibili network call, package dry run, commit, push, release, or Issue close was performed. GitHub Issue #3 is labeled `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization. The risk reviewer noted that `getVideoInfoWithSubtitle` still lacks a dedicated direct unit test, but the moved block is byte-identical and no blocking issue was found.

## 2026-07-19 Transient Subtitle Error Retry

- Commands: focused red/green `npm test -- --run tests/bilibili-transcript.test.ts -t "retries subtitle retrieval after a temporary error fallback"`; full transcript file; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped source/test diff review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The red test showed a first-call temporary subtitle error being cached as `description`, so the second call did not retry. The general-error catch branch no longer writes that fallback to the video cache. Codex independently verified 1/1 focused, 16/16 transcript, and 159/159 full-suite tests across 17 files; build and diff checks passed. Successful subtitle caching and `COOKIE_EXPIRED` propagation remain intact.
- Caveat: No real Bilibili network call, package dry run, commit, push, release, or Issue close was performed. GitHub Issue #4 is labeled `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization; CRLF conversion warnings remain informational.

## 2026-07-19 Comment Cache Detail-Level Separation

- Commands: focused red/green `npm test -- --run tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts -t "does not share cached results between brief and detailed modes with the same limit"`; full comments test file; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped source/test diff review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The red test showed `{ detailLevel: "detailed", limit: 5 }` reusing the cached one-comment brief result. The explicit-limit cache component now includes `detailLevel`. Codex independently verified 1/1 focused, 13/13 comments, and 160/160 full-suite tests across 17 files; build and diff checks passed. Identical options still reuse cache and public response shapes remain unchanged.
- Caveat: No real Bilibili network call, package dry run, commit, push, release, or Issue close was performed. GitHub Issue #5 is labeled `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization; CRLF conversion warnings remain informational.

## 2026-07-19 Real npm Test Guidance

- Commands: `npm test`; `npm run build`; expanded stale-guidance `rg` scan across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents`, and `.codex/agents`; exact-path secret and replacement-character scans; `git diff --check`; `python .codex/scripts/context_budget.py`; two bounded harness-security risk reviews.
- Result: Six current agent-rule files now treat `npm test` as the real unconditional Vitest gate. Codex's final run passed 17 files and 160 tests; build and all scoped scans passed. Always-loaded context decreased to an estimated 18,127 tokens, and no execution authority, hooks, permissions, trust boundaries, or historical records changed.
- Caveat: Repeated agent-side verification exposed a pre-existing intermittent failure in `tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts` (one failure among four runs, followed by a pass). It is separate from the documentation correction and requires its own diagnosis. No package dry run, commit, push, release, or Issue close was performed; Issue #6 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Stdio Smoke Readiness

- Commands: original 20-run focused loop; direct 20-process readiness-latency probe; post-fix focused test; agent and Codex 20-run focused loops; full `tests/mcp-server-smoke.test.ts`; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; fixed-sleep/debug-marker, replacement-character, and secret-pattern scans; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The original test failed at iteration 6 because stderr was still empty after its fixed 300ms sleep. The direct probe showed all 20 servers became ready, but 5 exceeded 300ms and the maximum was 453ms. The final test waits for the exact accumulated stderr signal with a 3s timeout, rejects on error/early exit, and awaits process closure. Codex independently verified 20/20 focused iterations, 2/2 smoke tests, 160/160 full-suite tests, build, and all scoped scans.
- Caveat: This is a test-only stabilization; no production stdio behavior, package contents, dependency, real client workflow, commit, push, release, or Issue close changed. Issue #7 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization; CRLF warnings remain informational.

## 2026-07-19 Redundant Comment Metadata Removal

- Commands: focused red/green `npm test -- --run tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts -t "does not fetch video metadata before delegating to the comments API"`; full comments test file; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; `rg -n "getVideoInfo|const cid" src/bilibili/comments.ts src/bilibili/comments-api.ts`; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The red test observed one outer `getVideoInfo` call. `comments.ts` no longer imports or calls it, while `comments-api.ts` still fetches metadata and computes `aid || cid`. Codex independently verified 1/1 focused, 14/14 comments, and 161/161 full-suite tests across 17 files; build and diff/ownership checks passed.
- Caveat: The test mocks the delegated comments API and guards outer-layer ownership; required lower-layer metadata ownership is additionally verified by direct source inspection. No live Bilibili request, package dry run, interface, commit, push, release, or Issue close changed. Issue #8 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Comment Limit Pagination

- Commands: failing-first `npx vitest run tests/bilibili-comments-tool.test.ts`; final focused comment tests; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped source/test review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: Three red regressions observed one request where pagination and early-stop behavior required multiple calls. The final implementation sequentially requests page sizes 20, 20, and 10 for `limit: 50`, stops on empty/short pages, truncates defensively, and preserves single requests at or below 20. Codex independently verified 20/20 comments tests and 167/167 full-suite tests across 17 files; build and diff checks passed.
- Caveat: `limit` counts top-level comments, so detailed-mode child reply expansion can make the final processed array longer; a deterministic regression verifies 50 top-level comments plus 50 child replies. No live Bilibili request, package dry run, schema, validation, response shape, commit, push, release, or Issue close changed. Issue #9 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Login Status Network Error Preservation

- Commands: pre-fix and post-fix no-file HTTP 503 harness; focused `tests/bilibili-http.test.ts` and `tests/server-error-next-steps.test.ts`; credential/subtitle/error regression group; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped debug/credential scan; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The pre-fix harness failed because HTTP 503 resolved as logged out. `checkLoginStatus` now delegates to `fetchWithoutWBI`, and `throttledFetch` maps native fetch `TypeError` to `NetworkError` with its original error. The same 503 harness now rejects with `NetworkError` and status 503. Codex independently verified 17/17 focused and 171/171 full-suite tests across 17 files; the MCP credential tool returns structured retryable `NETWORK_ERROR`; build and diff/scoped scans passed.
- Caveat: Immediate repeated connection failures inherit roughly 14-17 seconds of existing retry backoff, and repeated default 10-second timeouts may take roughly 54-57 seconds. Live Bilibili credentials, clients, package contents, release, commit, push, and Issue close were not exercised. QA is `pass with caveats`; Issue #10 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Non-Retryable HTTP Status Precedence

- Commands: pre-fix/post-fix zero-backoff 403 harness; focused `tests/retry.test.ts`, logger-redaction, and HTTP tests; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped debug scan; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The pre-fix harness observed four attempts for explicit HTTP 403. `shouldRetry` now immediately returns the status allowlist decision for numeric statuses and only applies name/code checks to status-less errors. The compact matrix verifies 403→1, 503→4, and status-less `NetworkError`→4. Codex independently verified 13/13 focused and 174/174 full-suite tests across 18 files; build, original harness, and diff/debug scans passed.
- Caveat: `src/bilibili/video-api.ts` has a pre-existing `NetworkError` construction without `statusCode`, so an HTTP 403 on that path still behaves like a status-less connection error; it was not changed under Issue #11. No package dry run, public interface, commit, push, release, or Issue close changed. Issue #11 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Subtitle HTTP Status Propagation

- Commands: focused pre-fix/post-fix `tests/bilibili-video-api.test.ts` 403 regression; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped source/test review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The pre-fix regression completed in about 0.6 seconds and observed four fetches with `statusCode: undefined`. `getSubtitleContent` now passes `response.status` into `NetworkError`. Codex independently verified 1/1 focused and 175/175 full-suite tests across 18 files; build and diff checks passed.
- Caveat: No live Bilibili 403, public schema, package contents, commit, push, release, or Issue close was exercised. Issue #12 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 WBI HTTP Status Propagation

- Commands: focused pre-fix/post-fix `tests/bilibili-wbi.test.ts`; combined WBI/video/retry tests; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped diff review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The pre-fix test completed in about 0.3 seconds and observed four fetches plus `statusCode: undefined`. The WBI path now passes `navRes.status` into the original `NetworkError` and carries it through the outer typed wrapper. Codex independently verified 11/11 focused and 176/176 full-suite tests across 19 files; build and diff checks passed.
- Caveat: No live Bilibili 403, package contents, public interface, commit, push, release, or Issue close was exercised. Issue #13 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 WBI Transport Retry And Timeout Cleanup

- Commands: focused pre-fix/post-fix WBI transport regression; combined WBI/video/retry tests; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped diff review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` review and top-level fallback risk review.
- Result: The pre-fix test observed one fetch and zero timeout cleanups. The WBI fetch boundary now converts native `TypeError` to status-less `NetworkError` before `withRetry` and clears the timeout in `finally`. Codex independently verified four attempts, four cleanup calls, explicit `statusCode: undefined`, preserved 403 behavior, 12/12 focused tests, and 177/177 full-suite tests across 19 files; build and diff checks passed.
- Caveat: The project `risk-reviewer` stalled after bounded waits, so its checklist was completed by the top-level Claude agent and independently rechecked by Codex. No live transport failure, package contents, public interface, commit, push, release, or Issue close was exercised. Issue #14 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-19 Fingerprint Timeout Cleanup

- Commands: pre-fix/post-fix focused fingerprint test; combined fingerprint/video/comment tests; full `npm test`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`; scoped caller/diff review; Paseo Claude implementation; `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: The pre-fix test observed a `null` fallback with zero timeout cleanups. `getBuvid` now clears the existing timer in `finally`. Codex independently verified one fetch, one cleanup, preserved `null`, 28/28 related tests, and 178/178 full-suite tests across 20 files; build and diff checks passed.
- Caveat: No live Bilibili fingerprint failure, package contents, public interface, commit, push, release, or Issue close was exercised. Issue #15 is `ready-for-human` pending Git authorization.

## 2026-07-20 v1.6.4 Pre-Release Gates

- Commands: `npm ci`; `npm run build`; `npm test`; focused MCP stdio smoke; `.codex/scripts/test_stop_summary.py`; `npm audit --omit=dev --json`; `npm pack --dry-run --json`; package-entry existence checks; high-confidence tracked-file secret scan; `git diff --check`.
- Result: Build passed; 20 Vitest files and 180 tests passed; the focused stdio smoke passed 2/2; hook tests passed 8/8; the production dependency audit reported zero vulnerabilities; the 1.6.4 tarball contains 120 expected files and excludes tests, local agent configuration, internal docs, and credential files; built main/types/bin targets exist; no high-confidence credential or token pattern was found.
- Caveat: The full development dependency audit reports four transitive development-tooling advisories (three moderate and one high). They are not production dependencies and are excluded from the published tarball, so they are recorded as non-blocking follow-up maintenance rather than expanded into the v1.6.4 reliability release. Live Bilibili and desktop-client matrix checks were not run.

## 2026-07-20 v1.6.4 Publication

- Commands: annotated tag push; GitHub Actions run inspection; `npm view @xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp`; post-publish `npx -y @xzxzzx/bilibili-mcp@1.6.4 --help`; npm attestation lookup; GitHub Release inspection; GitHub Issue closure checks.
- Result: The initial tag-triggered run failed before install because `npm@latest` resolved to npm 12.0.1, whose Node engine excluded the workflow's Node 22.14.0. Commit `3fd6f6f` pins npm 11.18.0, whose engine supports Node 22.14.0; the manual rerun `29695975757` then passed install, tests, build, and trusted publication. npm reports version/latest 1.6.4 with SLSA provenance, the fresh CLI help smoke passes, the non-draft GitHub Release exists, and Issues #2-#15 are closed.
- Caveat: The annotated `v1.6.4` tag remains on release commit `47b5486`; the workflow-only compatibility fix is the next commit on `master` and was used by the successful manual publish. The Actions runtime emitted a non-blocking notice that `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4` are forced from Node 20 to Node 24 by GitHub.

## 2026-07-20 MCP Server Version Synchronization

- Commands: Paseo-managed Claude Code implementation; `npm run build`; `npm test`; compiled `dist/server.js` metadata comparison against `package.json.version`; `git diff --check`; narrow `test-baseline-builder` and `risk-reviewer` reviews.
- Result: `src/server.ts` now reuses the root package version through the same Node ESM file-loading pattern already used by the CLI. The regression compares MCP SDK server metadata with `package.json.version`. Codex independently verified 20 test files and 181 tests, a clean build, and compiled server metadata version `1.6.4`.
- Caveat: The regression reads the SDK's private `_serverInfo` field, matching the repository's existing test-only `_requestHandlers` access. No dependency, package version, tool schema, response shape, release action, commit, or push changed; CRLF warnings remain informational.

## 2026-07-20 v1.6.5 Source Preparation

- Commands: `npm version 1.6.5 --no-git-tag-version`; `npm run build`; `npm test`; `npm audit --omit=dev --json`; `npm pack --dry-run --json`; compiled entry checks; clean-UTF-8 checks; intended-added-content credential scan; `git diff --check`; live `npm view`; `git fetch origin master`; Paseo `release-verifier` review.
- Result: Package and lockfile now report `1.6.5`; Chinese and English changelogs describe the MCP metadata version fix. Codex independently verified 20 files and 181 tests, a clean build, zero production vulnerabilities, 120 expected tarball entries with main/types/bin present and tests/internal handoffs excluded, zero high-confidence secret hits in intended added content, and no local/remote master divergence before commit.
- Caveat: The requested Paseo `package-maintainer` repair could not finish because the Paseo daemon stopped and repository rules prohibit restarting it without approval; Codex completed the same package metadata, dependency-diff, tarball-content, and lockfile checklist directly. No tag, npm publish, GitHub Release, or workflow change was performed.
